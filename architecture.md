Absolutely, that‚Äôs an *excellent* idea ‚Äî not only is it educational, but building your own language model from scratch (even a very small one) will give you a visceral understanding of tokenisation, attention mechanisms, embeddings, and more. Given your level of curiosity and technical skills, I‚Äôll make this a detailed yet *digestible* architectural overview. And no, it‚Äôs not a horrific idea to use Rust ‚Äî it just means you‚Äôll *really* understand memory safety and lifetimes by the end of it üòà

### üß† **Mini Language Model Design (LM from Scratch)**

#### 1. **Tokenisation**
- **Purpose:** Break input text into tokens (e.g. words, subwords, or characters).
- **Option:** Use character-level tokenisation (easier to implement), or a basic byte pair encoding (BPE) for a more realistic setup.
- **Output:** Integer token IDs.

```text
Input: "hello world"
Tokens: ['hel', 'lo', ' wor', 'ld']
Token IDs: [5, 9, 27, 42]
```

#### 2. **Embeddings**
- Map token IDs to dense vectors.
- Just a matrix: `embedding_matrix[token_id] ‚Üí vector`.

```math
E: V √ó d, where V = vocab size, d = embedding dimension
```

---

#### 3. **Model Core: Transformer Block (simplified)**
A stack of layers, each made of:

##### (a) **Self-Attention Layer**
- Allows the model to "look" at other tokens.
- For each token:
  - Compute `Query`, `Key`, `Value` vectors.
  - Compute attention scores: `softmax(QK·µÄ / sqrt(d_k))`
  - Use scores to mix `Value` vectors.

```math
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK·µÄ / ‚àöd_k) V
```

##### (b) **Feed-Forward Layer**
- A simple 2-layer MLP applied *per token*:
```math
FFN(x) = max(0, xW‚ÇÅ + b‚ÇÅ)W‚ÇÇ + b‚ÇÇ
```

##### (c) **Layer Normalisation** and **Residual Connections**
- Each sublayer gets:
```math
x + Sublayer(LayerNorm(x))
```

---

#### 4. **Positional Encoding**
- Since transformers don't have recurrence, we need to inject *position* info.
- Add sinusoidal or learned vectors to input embeddings.

---

#### 5. **Stacking Layers**
- N transformer blocks (e.g. 2‚Äì6 for a toy LM).
- Each layer has its own attention + feedforward.

---

#### 6. **Output Layer**
- A linear projection from hidden size to vocab size.
- Softmax to get probabilities.

```math
Logits: H √ó V
Softmax ‚Üí Probabilities of next token
```

---

#### 7. **Training**
- Objective: Predict next token.
- Loss: Cross-entropy between predicted and actual next token.
- Dataset: Small text corpus (e.g. Shakespeare, poetry, or your own notes).
- Optimiser: Adam is the classic choice.

---

#### 8. **Inference (Generation)**
- Input a prompt.
- Get next token ‚Üí feed it back into model ‚Üí repeat.

### ü¶Ä Implementing It in Rust

Rust is... unforgiving but elegant. Here's a rough plan:

1. **Tokeniser**
   - Write your own BPE or use character-level encoding.
2. **Tensor Types**
   - You can write your own fixed-size arrays or use `ndarray` crate.
3. **Matrix Multiplication**
   - Either via `ndarray`, or implement your own dot product if you're feeling bold.
4. **Model Layers**
   - Encapsulate layers in structs (`Attention`, `FeedForward`, `TransformerBlock`)
5. **Training**
   - Implement basic backprop manually (for masochists) or use `autograd` crates like `burn`, `candle`, or `tch-rs`.

### üîß Suggested Crates (Rust Libraries)
| Task | Crate |
|------|-------|
| Arrays & Matrices | `ndarray` |
| Autograd / Training | `burn`, `candle`, or `tch-rs` |
| Tokenisation | Write your own, or adapt a BPE in Rust |
| Logging | `tracing` |
| Visualisation | Output to `CSV` and visualise in Python/Matplotlib |

---

### üìè Suggested Model Size for First Build
| Component        | Value           |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Vocab Size       | 100 (if char-level) |
| Embedding Dim    | 32              |
| Hidden Dim       | 64              |
| Transformer Layers | 2‚Äì4           |
| Sequence Length  | 64              |

This will fit easily in RAM, train on CPU, and won't roast your T2 chip.

Would you like me to provide a visual diagram of the architecture or a sample Rust file structure to get started?
