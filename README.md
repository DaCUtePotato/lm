## Bonjour
First, clone this repo:
```git clone https://github.com/DaCUtePotato/lm.git```
To run (train) the lm, you need to get yourself a giant dataset in txt format and copy it into vocab-tokens. 
Make sure you have Rust and Cargo etc. installed.
Then, cd into the directory, cd into vocab-tokens and 
```cargo r -r``` 
(-r for more speeeeeeed)
You will need to copy vocab-tokens and tokens.bin into the lm directory.
Then, run 
```cargo r -r``` 
again to run it.
